# Roblox Alt Storage (Node.JS Script)
This is a node.js server created to let you store your Roblox Alt Accounts. <br>
Basically, you store your alts in alts.json first, then, when you want to use an alt account, you must create a new Roblox account to get the oldest available alt account on Roblox. This "password system" allows you to use alts, and as a byproduct it also uses your newly generated Roblox alt account and lets it age so you can bypass minimum age requirements on Roblox Games! Think of this less of Roblox Alt Manager, more of a Roblox Alt Ager.
